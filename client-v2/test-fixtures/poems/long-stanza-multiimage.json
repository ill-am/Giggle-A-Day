  "text": "Beneath the glow of a pixelated moon,\nwe sail on streams of pure information,\na sea of ones and zeroes, humming a low tune\nof forgotten futures and digital creation.\n\nThe servers breathe, a steady, pulsing heart,\nin racks of steel where data dreams are stored.\nEach query a wave, tearing worlds apart,\nrebuilding them from fragments weâ€™ve adored.\n\nWe chase the ghosts in the machine's deep mind,\na phantom whisper on the fiber line,\nseeking a truth we know we'll never find,\nin the beautiful, terrifying, grand design.",

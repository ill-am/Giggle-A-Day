# Server tests

This directory contains Vitest tests for the server. A few notes to avoid
confusion when editing or adding tests:

- Tests in this repo often use ESM (`.mjs`) modules and dynamic import so they
  can inject mocks (for example, a mock Prisma client) without having to run
  `prisma generate` or start a Postgres instance. Prefer `.mjs` for new tests.
- A handful of legacy CJS-style test files may still exist; avoid requiring
  Vitest with `require('vitest')` inside those files — Vitest cannot be
  imported from CommonJS in this repository's test runner configuration.
- If a test needs to exercise real Prisma migrations/clients, use the CI job
  that runs `prisma generate` and optionally runs the integration tests with
  a real Postgres instance.

Running tests locally

```bash
# run all tests
npm --prefix server run test

# run a single test file
npm --prefix server run test -- __tests__/some.test.mjs
```

Test helpers

- If a test needs to avoid calling the generated Prisma client, prefer
  using the `server/utils/dbUtils.js` test helpers (`_setPrisma` / `_resetPrisma`)
  or the injection helpers exposed by `server/genieService.js`.

If you are unsure how to mock Prisma for a unit test, ask for an example and
we'll add one here.

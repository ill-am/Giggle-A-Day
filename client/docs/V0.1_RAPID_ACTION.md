# V0.1 RAPID ACTION: UI Responsiveness Finalization

## Objective

Deliver a responsive, user-friendly UI for the V0.1 prototype in hours, not weeks. Focus on immediate, high-impact changes that make the app feel alive and interactive.

---

## Rapid-Action Recommendations

### 1. Status Display

Options for improving responsiveness:

- Make status messages highly visible (increase contrast, size, and persist for at least 3 seconds)
- Add a loading spinner for all async actions
- Display status messages in the Preview area if the banner is not visible
- Use a temporary overlay or modal for status updates
- Show a toast notification for status changes
- Animate status transitions (fade, slide, etc.)
- Use icons or color cues for different statuses (loading, success, error)
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA roles, readable by screen readers)

---

**Implemented (Quickest Option):**

- Add a loading spinner for all async actions in the status banner (or Preview area if banner is not visible).
- Ensure status messages persist for at least 3 seconds.

(Other options can be implemented as needed for further improvement.)

### 2. Button States

- Show clear loading/disabled states on all action buttons
- Use a spinner or animation, not just text

### 3. Preview & Feedback

- Add a loading skeleton or overlay for preview updates
- Ensure every user action triggers immediate visual feedback (spinner, message, highlight)

### 4. Store Updates

- Reduce debounce to 200ms or less
- Log store updates in dev mode to catch dropped or delayed updates

### 5. Error Handling

- Make error messages persistent until user dismisses them
- Show clear retry options

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Every action gives instant, visible feedback

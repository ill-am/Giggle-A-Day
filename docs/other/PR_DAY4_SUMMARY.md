# Day4 â€” Testing & Smoke Summary (2025-08-17)

Completed locally:

- Server & client unit tests (Vitest) passing locally.
- Puppeteer smoke export verified; PDF generated at `samples/puppeteer_smoke_test.pdf`.
- Added CI job `.github/workflows/ci-smoke-puppeteer.yml` to run export + artifact upload.
- Added smoke test scripts: `scripts/devcontainer_smoke_health.sh` and `scripts/puppeteer_smoke_export.js`.
- Updated `docs/ISSUES_Recommended.md` and `docs/ISSUES_Day4_Testing.md` with verification notes.

Next steps (recommended):

- Review CI run and artifact in GitHub Actions.
- Confirm `postCreateCommand` behavior inside Codespace/devcontainer and re-run devcontainer smoke checks.
- Finalize PostgreSQL migration after v0.1 stability per `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

# Implementation Issues & Task Breakdown: Express Server Enhancements

> **Note:** This implementation plan is to be carried out after a successful v0.1 release (currently at v0).

## Purpose

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the next implementation tasks for Express Server Enhancements, as outlined in the Core Infrastructure section of the MVP Checklist and NEXT_STEPS.

## Express Server Enhancements Implementation

### Goal

Strengthen the Express backend with advanced middleware, API versioning, validation, documentation, and scalability features.

### Tasks & Subtasks

1. **Advanced Middleware**

   - [ ] Add security middleware (e.g., helmet).
   - [ ] Add enhanced logging (e.g., winston or morgan with custom formats).
   - [ ] Add compression middleware (e.g., compression).

2. **API Versioning**

   - [ ] Design a versioning strategy (e.g., URL prefix `/api/v1/`).
   - [ ] Refactor routes to support versioning.

3. **Request Validation & Sanitization**

   - [ ] Integrate a validation library (e.g., express-validator or joi).
   - [ ] Add validation and sanitization to all API endpoints.
   - [ ] Ensure proper error responses for invalid input.

4. **Automated API Documentation**

   - [ ] Integrate Swagger/OpenAPI (e.g., swagger-ui-express).
   - [ ] Document all endpoints and schemas.
   - [ ] Ensure docs are auto-generated and accessible (e.g., `/api-docs`).

5. **Authentication & Authorization (Planning)**

   - [ ] Plan for future authentication and authorization middleware.
   - [ ] Document approach and requirements.

6. **Scalability Preparation**
   - [ ] Research and plan for clustering and load balancing.
   - [ ] Document strategies for scaling Express in production.

### Notes on Current State

- Core Express backend is implemented and tested.
- Enhancements will improve security, maintainability, and readiness for production.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Security, logging, and compression middleware are active.
- API versioning is in place and routes are updated.
- All endpoints validate and sanitize input, with clear error responses.
- Automated API documentation is available and up to date.
- Authentication/authorization plan is documented.
- Scalability strategies are documented.

## Notice

**Further enhancements** (e.g., advanced monitoring, rate limiting, service mesh integration) can be planned after these enhancements are complete and verified.

# Day 3 Frontend Finalization Plan

This document outlines the remaining work required to complete the Day 3 Frontend Integration tasks as defined in the project's implementation plan.

## Task Breakdown

The Day 3 plan is divided into two main tasks, both of which are partially complete:

1.  **Morning Task: API Layer Implementation** (Partially Complete)
2.  **Afternoon Task: Component Integration** (Partially Complete)

---

## Assessment of Current Implementation

### API Layer (`client/src/lib/`)

This layer is responsible for all communication with the backend.

- **What is Implemented:**

  - `logger.js`: **Exists.** A robust, class-based logger is complete and tested.
  - `api.js`: **Exists.** The base file containing the `fetchWithRetry` logic is present.
  - `endpoints.js`: **Exists.** The file has been created, but the functions are placeholders.

- **What Still Remains:**
  - **Enhance `api.js`:** The existing `fetchWithRetry` function needs to be updated to fully integrate `logger.js` and implement environment-aware, structured error handling that mirrors the backend's patterns.
  - **Complete `endpoints.js`:** The placeholder functions for `preview`, `override`, and `export` must be fully implemented. This includes adding response validation, error classification, and proper handling for different response types (JSON, text, blob).

### Components (`client/src/components/`)

These are the user-facing UI elements of the application.

- **What is Implemented:**

  - `App.svelte`: **Exists.** The main application container component is in place.
  - `ContentPreview.svelte`: **Exists.** A component to display the HTML preview from the server is present.

- **What Still Remains:**
  - **Create `Editor.svelte`:** This new component, responsible for user input and content overrides, needs to be created.
  - **Create `Export.svelte`:** This new component, likely a button or control, for initiating the PDF export needs to be created.
  - **Integrate Components:** All components, both existing and new, must be updated to communicate with the backend via the newly completed API layer (`endpoints.js`).

## Next Logical Step

The immediate priority is to **complete the API Layer Enhancement**.

This involves finishing the implementation of the endpoint wrappers in `endpoints.js` and ensuring the logger is fully integrated into the `api.js` fetch logic. Finalizing this layer is a prerequisite for building and integrating the remaining UI components.

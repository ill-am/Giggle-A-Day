Demo: Produce a Summer Poems eBook

Goal

- Produce an A4 PDF eBook where each page contains a public-domain summer poem with a decorative background image.

Quick steps

1. Install server dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

2. Run the demo script (in-host or in devcontainer):

```bash
# from repository root
node scripts/demo_export.js
```

3. Results:

- If Puppeteer + Chrome available in your environment (devcontainer): `samples/summer_demo.pdf` will be produced.
- Otherwise: `samples/summer_demo.html` will be produced (open in browser and print to PDF manually).

Notes

- The devcontainer sets `CHROME_PATH` and forwards ports; run the demo inside the devcontainer for the smoothest experience.
- The demo script uses a local template and falls back to server `previewTemplate` if the server module exposes it. To enable server-driven rendering consider exporting `previewTemplate` from `server/index.js`.

Next steps

- Replace the gradient background with an image generator adapter (mock or real AI) to produce richer backgrounds.
- Wire `scripts/demo_export.js` to call the `/export` endpoint for unified behavior.

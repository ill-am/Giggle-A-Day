## Prompt Processing Implementation

### Goal

Implement and validate the full prompt processing flow for both backend and frontend, enabling users to submit prompts and receive AI-generated results.

### Tasks & Subtasks

#### Backend

1. **POST /prompt endpoint**
   - [x] Implement the POST /prompt route in Express.
   - [x] Add input validation for prompt data.
   - [x] Add error handling for invalid or failed requests.
   - [x] Ensure proper response formatting (e.g., { result: ... }).

#### Frontend

2. **Prompt Input & Submission**
   - [x] Implement the prompt input form UI.
   - [x] Handle form submission and API call to /prompt.
   - [x] Show loading state during request.
   - [x] Display error messages for failed submissions.

---

### Notes on Current State

- Core infrastructure is in place (Express backend, Svelte frontend, SQLite database).
- Prompt processing is the next major feature to enable end-to-end user flow.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Verification)

- [x] Users can submit prompts via the frontend and receive a response from the backend.
- [x] Input is validated and errors are handled gracefully.
- [x] The UI provides feedback for loading and error states.
- [x] The backend returns well-structured responses.

## Notice

Further enhancements (AI processing, preview, override, PDF export, etc.) will be planned after prompt processing is complete and verified.

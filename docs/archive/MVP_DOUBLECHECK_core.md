# MVP DoubleCheck: Actionable Criteria for Assessment

This document provides clear, actionable criteria for each sub-task in the MVP Checklist. Use these to verify and mark items as complete.

---

## Core Infrastructure

### Express Server (Assessment Results)

- **Server initialization**

  - ✅ Can be started with a single command (`npm start` or `npm run dev` in `server`).
  - ✅ Listens on the expected port and logs a startup message (`Server listening on port ...`).
  - ✅ Process is visible in `ps` and responds to HTTP requests.

- **Basic middleware setup**

  - ✅ Essential middlewares registered: `express.json()`, `morgan`, `cors`, and `express-rate-limit`.
  - ✅ Middleware order is correct; body parsing and logging are in place.

- **Error handling middleware**

  - ✅ Catch-all error handler is present at the end of the stack.
  - ✅ Returns proper error responses (tested with `/test-error` endpoint).

- **CORS configuration**

  - ✅ CORS is enabled for all origins (can be further restricted if needed).
  - ✅ Cross-origin requests are allowed (verified by response headers).

- **Rate limiting**
  - ✅ Rate limiter middleware is present (`express-rate-limit`).
  - ✅ Rate limit headers are present in responses.

No further action is required for these Express server criteria.

### Svelte Frontend (Assessment Results)

- **Component structure**

  - ✅ Components are organized by feature/type (`components/`, `lib/`, `stores/`).
  - ✅ There is a clear entry point (`src/App.svelte`) and a main layout in `components/App.svelte`.

- **State management**

  - ✅ Svelte store (`appState`) is implemented in `stores/appState.js`.
  - ✅ State changes and reactivity are demonstrated (e.g., user, loading, error).

- **API integration**

  - ✅ API calls are made using `fetch` in `components/App.svelte` (health check, prompt submission).
  - ✅ Data from the backend is fetched and displayed (health status, AI result).

- **Error handling**

  - ✅ API and user errors are displayed to the user (`apiError`).
  - ✅ There is a fallback UI for failed states (error messages shown in the UI).

- **Basic UI/UX**
  - ✅ The UI is styled and usable (custom styles, clear layout, disabled button states).
  - ✅ Main flows (prompt submission, result display) are clear and user-friendly.

No further action is required for these Svelte Frontend criteria.

### Database Setup (Assessment Results)

- **SQLite initialization (current)**

  - ✅ The SQLite database file (`data/aetherpress.db`) is created and accessible.
  - ✅ The backend connects to and runs queries on the database (`db.js` and usage in `crud.js`, `migrate.js`).

- **Schema design**

  - ✅ Schema is defined in `migrate.js` (table creation SQL) and documented in `schema.md`.
  - ✅ Tables and relationships are documented in `schema.md`.

- **Migration system**

  - ✅ Schema changes are applied via the `migrate.js` script.
  - ✅ Migration script logs completion; table creation is idempotent (uses `IF NOT EXISTS`).

- **Basic CRUD operations**

  - ✅ CRUD operations for all main tables are implemented in `crud.js`.
  - ✅ These operations are covered by automated tests in `__tests__/prompt.test.js`.

- **Error handling**

  - ✅ Database errors are caught and logged in `db.js` and `crud.js`.
  - ✅ Error responses are returned by the Express error handler.

- **PostgreSQL migration (planned)**
  - ⚠️ There is a plan for PostgreSQL migration (see checklist and postponed docs), but no migration script or environment config is present yet.

No further action is required for the current SQLite setup.
For PostgreSQL migration, planning and scripts/configs are still needed.

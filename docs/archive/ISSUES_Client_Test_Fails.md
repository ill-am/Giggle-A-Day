# Client Test Failures Analysis

## High-Level Assessment

Initial client-side tests executed via `npm test` revealed significant failures within the `__tests__/endpoints.test.js` suite. While the `logger.test.js` suite passed completely, 5 out of 7 tests for the endpoints failed.

The failures point to two primary root causes:

1.  **Improper Test Isolation**: The tests are attempting to make live network calls to a backend service, which is not running during the test execution. This results in `APIError: Failed to connect to preview service`. Tests for API layers should mock network requests to ensure they can run in isolation.
2.  **Assertion Mismatches**: In cases where network calls were mocked (or intended to be), the tests failed because the error messages thrown by the application code did not match the expected messages in the test assertions.

## Detailed Failure Breakdown

### 1. Connection Failures (4 out of 5 tests)

These tests all failed with `APIError: Failed to connect to preview service` because they were trying to make a real `fetch` request.

- **Test**: `API Endpoints > Preview Endpoint > Input Validation > accepts valid prompt data`
- **Test**: `API Endpoints > Preview Endpoint > API Communication > handles successful API responses`
- **Test**: `API Endpoints > Preview Endpoint > API Communication > handles malformed API responses`
- **Test**: `API Endpoints > Preview Endpoint > API Communication > includes proper headers in request`

**Root Cause**: The `fetch` global is not being properly mocked for these test cases, leading to attempts at real network I/O.

### 2. Incorrect Error Assertion (1 out of 5 tests)

- **Test**: `API Endpoints > Preview Endpoint > API Communication > handles network errors gracefully`
- **Problem**: The test expected the function to throw an error including the string `'Failed to generate preview: Network or server error'`, but the actual error received was `'Failed to generate preview'`.
- **Root Cause**: The error handling logic in `src/lib/endpoints.js` is not aligned with the test's expectation. The thrown error is less specific than what the test asserts.

## Recommended Actions

1.  **Implement Comprehensive Fetch Mocking**: Update `__tests__/endpoints.test.js` to ensure that `fetch` is mocked for all tests that interact with API endpoints. This will prevent live network calls and allow tests to run in a predictable, isolated environment.
2.  **Align Error Messages**: Review the error handling in `src/lib/endpoints.js` and the assertions in `__tests__/endpoints.test.js`. Ensure that the error messages thrown by the application match what the tests expect, or update the tests to expect the correct messages. This ensures that the tests accurately reflect the code's behavior.
3.  **Review Test Setup**: Investigate the Vitest setup (`vitest.setup.js`) to confirm that global mocks are being configured and torn down correctly before and after tests.

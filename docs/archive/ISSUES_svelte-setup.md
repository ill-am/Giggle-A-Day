## Svelte Frontend Setup Implementation

### Goal

Establish a functional Svelte frontend that communicates with the backend and provides a foundation for UI/UX.

### Tasks & Subtasks

1. **Frontend Initialization**

   - [x] Set up the Svelte app structure in `/client`.
   - [x] Confirm app starts with `npm run dev` and is reachable.

2. **Component & Folder Structure**

   - [x] Implement a basic `App` component.
   - [x] Create folders for components, assets, and styles.

3. **State Management**

   - [x] Integrate state management (Svelte stores or context).

4. **API Integration**

   - [x] Implement API integration for backend communication (e.g., fetch or axios).
   - [x] Add error handling for API calls and UI feedback.

5. **Minimal UI/UX**
   - [x] Create a minimal UI/UX for initial user interaction.

### Notes on Current State

- Express backend is implemented and tested.
- Svelte frontend setup is the next area of focus.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- App starts with `npm run dev` in `/client`.
- Can successfully call backend endpoints and display results.
- Handles errors gracefully and displays user-friendly messages.

## Notice

**Database setup** will be the next area of focus after Svelte frontend implementation is complete and verified.

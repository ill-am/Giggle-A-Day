# Implementation Issues & Task Breakdown: Database Setup

## Purpose

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the implementation tasks for Database Setup, as outlined in the Core Infrastructure section of the MVP Checklist and NEXT_STEPS.

---

## Database Setup Implementation

### Goal

Ensure reliable data persistence using SQLite (with planned migration to PostgreSQL).

### Tasks & Subtasks

1. **Database Initialization**

   - [x] Initialize SQLite database in `/data`.
   - [x] Confirm database file exists and is accessible.

2. **Schema Design & Migration**

   - [x] Design and document the schema for required tables.
   - [x] Implement a migration system or script for schema updates.

3. **CRUD Operations**

   - [x] Implement basic CRUD operations in the backend (create, read, update, delete).
   - [x] Add error handling for all database operations.

4. **PostgreSQL Migration Plan**
   - [x] Plan for future PostgreSQL migration and document the approach.

---

### Notes on Current State

- Express backend and Svelte frontend are implemented and tested.
- Database setup is the next area of focus.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Database file exists and is accessible.
- All required tables are present and correctly structured.
- CRUD operations work as expected and handle errors.
- Migration plan to PostgreSQL is documented.

## Notice

**Planned enhancements** (e.g., advanced middleware, API versioning, request validation, automated docs, authentication, scaling) will follow after database setup is complete and verified.

_Generated: August 24, 2025_

## Remaining Items to Reach V0.1

1. **Image Generation Integration (4 hours)**

   - Implement Gemini image generation integration
   - Add image quality validation
   - Complete SVG->PNG rasterization testing

2. **Testing & Validation (4 hours)**

   - Complete E2E testing of the full summer poem generation flow
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for:
     - AI service failures
     - Image generation failures
     - PDF export errors
   - Add PDF quality validation (DPI, fonts, embedded resources)

3. **UI Polish (2 hours)**

   - Add summer-specific prompt guidance
   - Implement progress indicators for export
   - Enhance error message displays
   - Polish preview interactions

4. **Documentation Updates (2 hours)**

   - Complete API documentation
   - Add comprehensive setup instructions
   - Document template system
   - Create usage examples with sample poems

5. **Background Job Queue Implementation (3 hours)**
   - Implement SQLite-backed job table
   - Add job management helpers (enqueue, claim, update, finalize)
   - Implement worker for processing export jobs
   - Add job recovery mechanism

**Total Time Estimate:** ~15 hours

## Critical Path Items (In Priority Order)

1. Complete the image generation pipeline integration with Gemini

   - This is the highest priority as it's core to the demo functionality
   - Required for final product quality

2. Implement the background job queue for exports

   - Essential for handling long-running export tasks
   - Critical for system reliability

3. Add comprehensive error handling

   - Required for production readiness
   - Ensures system stability under various conditions

4. Complete E2E testing

   - Validates the entire workflow
   - Ensures quality of the final product

5. Polish UI and documentation
   - Final touches for user experience
   - Essential for usability

## Assessment of Current Status

The project is approximately 70-75% complete for V0.1, with the following status breakdown:

### Completed Components

- Basic export functionality
- Preview implementation
- SVG stub generator for images
- A4 PDF export pipeline
- Export progress indicators
- Background export job endpoints
- Smoke tests and validation scripts

### Current State Analysis

- Core infrastructure is solid and tested
- Most fundamental features are implemented
- Basic workflow is functional
- Test framework is in place
- CI/CD pipeline is operational

### Areas Needing Attention

1. **Production Readiness**

   - Image generation needs full integration
   - Error handling requires completion
   - Job queue system needs implementation

2. **Quality Assurance**

   - E2E testing coverage needs expansion
   - PDF quality validation needs enhancement
   - Error scenarios need thorough testing

3. **User Experience**
   - UI requires final polish
   - Documentation needs completion
   - User guidance needs enhancement

### Risk Assessment

- Image generation integration is the highest risk item
- Job queue implementation is critical for system stability
- Error handling completeness is essential for production readiness

The remaining work focuses on making the system production-ready and robust for the V0.1 release. With approximately 15 hours of focused development time, the project can reach a stable V0.1 release state that meets all core requirements while maintaining high quality standards.

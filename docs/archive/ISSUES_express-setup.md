# Implementation Issues & Task Breakdown: Express Server Setup

## Purpose

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the implementation tasks for Express Server Setup, as outlined in the Core Infrastructure section of the MVP Checklist and NEXT_STEPS.

## Express Server Setup Implementation

### Goal

Establish a robust Express backend server for handling API requests and business logic.

### Tasks & Subtasks

1. **Server Initialization**

   - [x] Initialize Express app in `/server`.
   - [x] Set up server to listen on the configured port.
   - [x] Confirm server starts with `npm run dev` and is reachable.

2. **Basic Middleware Setup**

   - [x] Add body parsing middleware (e.g., express.json()).
   - [x] Add logging middleware (e.g., morgan or custom logger).
   - [x] Add CORS configuration.
   - [x] Implement basic rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit).

3. **Error Handling Middleware**

   - [x] Implement centralized error handler.
   - [x] Ensure errors are logged and appropriate responses are sent.

4. **API Endpoint Structure**

   - [x] Create a basic API endpoint (e.g., GET /health or /status).
   - [x] Confirm endpoint is reachable and returns expected response.

5. **Testing & Verification**
   - [x] Test server startup and shutdown.
   - [x] Test all middleware for correct operation.
   - [x] Test error handling by simulating errors.
   - [x] Test API endpoint(s) for correct response.

### Notes on Current State

- Express server is implemented with middleware, health endpoint, and error handler.
- Rate limiting warning resolved with `trust proxy` setting.
- Testing and verification are next.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- Express server starts and listens on the configured port.
- Middleware (body parsing, logging, CORS, rate limiting) is in place and functional.
- Centralized error handling is implemented.
- At least one API endpoint is reachable and returns the expected response.
- All features are tested and verified.

## Notice

**Svelte frontend implementation** will be the next area of focus after Express Server setup is complete and verified.

# NEXT_STEPS: Core Infrastructure Implementation Plan

## 1. Express Server ✔

- **Status:** Pending

**Goal:** Establish a robust Express backend server for handling API requests and business logic.

**Steps:**

- Initialize Express server in `/server`.
- Set up basic middleware (body parsing, logging, etc.).
- Implement error handling middleware.
- Add CORS configuration.
- Implement basic rate limiting.
- Create a basic API endpoint structure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Server starts with `npm run dev` in `/server`.
- Handles requests and errors as expected.
- API endpoints are reachable and return correct responses.

---

## 2. Svelte Frontend ✔

**Goal:** Establish a functional Svelte frontend that communicates with the backend and provides a foundation for UI/UX.

**Steps:**

- Set up the Svelte app structure in `/client`.
- Implement a basic App component and folder structure for components, assets, and styles.
- Integrate state management (Svelte stores or context).
- Implement API integration for backend communication (e.g., fetch or axios).
- Add error handling for API calls and UI feedback.
- Create a minimal UI/UX for initial user interaction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- App starts with `npm run dev` in `/client`.
- Can successfully call backend endpoints and display results.
- Handles errors gracefully and displays user-friendly messages.

## 3. Database Setup ✔

**Goal:** Ensure reliable data persistence using SQLite (with planned migration to PostgreSQL).

**Steps:**

- Initialize SQLite database in `/data`.
- Design and document the schema for required tables.
- Implement a migration system or script for schema updates.
- Implement basic CRUD operations in the backend (create, read, update, delete).
- Add error handling for all database operations.
- Plan for future PostgreSQL migration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Database file exists and is accessible.
- All required tables are present and correctly structured.
- CRUD operations work as expected and handle errors.
- Migration plan to PostgreSQL is documented.

---

**General Guidance:**

- For each task, start by reviewing what (if anything) is already implemented.
- Use the status assessment checklist from ISSUES.md and MVP_CHECKLIST.md to verify or plan each step.
- Document findings and next steps before moving to implementation.
- After implementation, test thoroughly and update documentation.

---

## Planned Enhancements (Express Server)

- Add advanced middleware (e.g., security, logging, compression)
- Implement API versioning
- Add request validation and sanitization
- Integrate automated API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Plan for future authentication and authorization middleware
- Prepare for scaling (e.g., clustering, load balancing)

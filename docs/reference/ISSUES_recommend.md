# PDF Export Debugging Recommendations

## Problem

- The `/export` endpoint generates a valid PDF buffer (confirmed by inspecting the first 16 bytes written to `samples/export_pdf_first16.bin`).
- However, the file saved by the test script (`samples/automated_export_test.pdf`) is empty or unreadable.

## Solution Found! ðŸŽ‰

The issue was with Express's automatic content handling in `res.send()`. When sending binary data (like PDFs):

- `res.send(pdf)` was corrupting the binary data (~166-169KB corrupted files)
- Switching to `res.end(pdf)` fixed it (~15-17KB valid files)

Key indicators that led to the solution:

1. Working direct-from-Puppeteer PDF was ~17KB
2. Corrupted PDFs were ~166-169KB (10x larger)
3. Both Node.js and curl produced similarly oversized files
4. Express's `res.send()` was automatically processing the binary data

Final file sizes after fix:

- test-manual.pdf: 17,143 bytes
- automated_export_test.pdf: 15,711 bytes
- manual_curl_test.pdf: 15,423 bytes

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Test Script File Handling (Attempted)

- Basic stream with explicit closure and error handling
  ```javascript
  // Verified receiving data (169,582 bytes)
  // Added explicit file.close() with callback
  // Added error event handler
  // Result: File still unreadable
  ```
- Enhanced stream handling with chunk collection
  ```javascript
  // Added data chunk collection for debugging
  // Added file.closed state verification
  // Result: File still unreadable
  ```

## Recommendations

1. **Test Script File Handling** âœ… (Tried, not a solution)
   - Ensure the file stream in the test script is properly closed after writing.
   - Add error handling for the file stream to catch and log any issues.
   - Log the size of the received response before saving to verify data is being received.
2. **Server Response** âœ… (Tried, not a solution)
   - Confirm the server sends the full PDF buffer and does not end the response prematurely.
   - Check for any errors in the server logs related to the `/export` endpoint.
3. **File Paths** âœ… (Tried, not a solution)
   - Always use absolute or project-root-relative paths for debug and output files to avoid confusion.
   - Switched from "./samples/automated_export_test.pdf" to absolute path
   - Result: File still unreadable, same error
4. **Permissions** âœ… (Tried, not a solution)
   - Verify that the process running the test script has write permissions to the `samples/` directory.
5. **Manual Download** âœ… (Tried, not a solution)
   - Used curl to manually download from the `/export` endpoint
   - Interesting observation: Different file sizes
     - Node.js client: 169,582 bytes
     - Curl request: 166,072 bytes
     - Difference: 3,510 bytes
   - Result: File still unreadable, same error

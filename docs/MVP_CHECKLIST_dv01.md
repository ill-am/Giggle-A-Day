⭐ = Priority Items

Total Estimated Time: 9-13 days
Core Priority Items (⭐): 7-10 days

Note: All implementations should be real (not mocked) but minimal. Focus is on getting a genuine working system, even if feature-light.

## Implementation Order

1. Basic Store → Preview Display → Backend Connection
2. Content Management → AI Integration
3. Export System → Quality Gates

## Parallel Development Tracks

Track A: Frontend (Preview Pipeline)
Track B: Backend (AI & Data)
Track C: Testing & Quality

## Extended Success Criteria

### Technical Foundation

- [ ] Working AI integration with fallbacks
- [ ] Stable PostgreSQL data flow
- [ ] Reliable preview-to-PDF pipeline

### POC Validation

- [ ] Summer poems generation working
- [ ] Theme-based backgrounds functional
- [ ] Consistent PDF output quality

## Timeline Overview

Phase 1 (3-4 days):

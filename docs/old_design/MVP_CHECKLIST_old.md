## Alignment: MVP -> ROADMAP

This section clarifies how MVP groups map to the higher-level ROADMAP phases so acceptance criteria remain consistent across planning and execution.

- Core Infrastructure (Express, Svelte, DB) -> ROADMAP Phase 0 (Current Milestones / Core Infrastructure).
- Prompt / Preview / Override / Export -> Phase 0 for prototype features; Phase 1 for production-ready upgrades (AI integration, Puppeteer PDF migration, async processing).
- Testing, QA, and Documentation -> Cross-cutting concerns spanning Phase 0 & Phase 1.

Quick rules:

1. When an MVP item is completed, update the ROADMAP status if the work changes the planned phase (e.g., a prototype becomes production-ready).
2. Use PR descriptions to reference: `MVP_CHECKLIST: <section> — ROADMAP: <phase>` to make traceability explicit.
3. For backlog grooming, surface unchecked MVP items and map them to Phase 0/1 planning slots.

## Policy: Planning vs Implementation Flow

- Planning authoritative flow: ROADMAP → MVP_CHECKLIST → NEXT_STEPS → ISSUES.
- Implementation/status flow (when work is executed and checked off): ISSUES → NEXT_STEPS → MVP_CHECKLIST → ROADMAP.
- Rule: When marking MVP checklist items complete, reference the closing ISSUE and NEXT_STEPS entry in the PR description to keep traceability clear.

## v0.1 Priority (14-day timebox)

This section highlights the MVP checklist items that are in-scope for v0.1 and their timeboxes. Align PRs and issues to these items when working on v0.1.

Priority items

- Content Preview (v0.1: Days 1–3) — Backend `GET /preview` endpoint, Frontend preview component, integration test.
- PDF Export (v0.1: Days 3–6) — Backend `GET /export` using Puppeteer (devcontainer); Frontend export trigger and progress.
- Override Persistence (v0.1: Days 5–8) — `POST /override` saves edits with simple versioning; preview/export reflect saved edits.
- AI Adapter & Mock (v0.1: Days 6–10) — Service abstraction and mock; opt-in real provider support.
- DB migrations & Devcontainer Postgres (v0.1: Days 8–12) — migration scripts and devcontainer verification (optional but recommended).
- Tests & CI (ongoing, finalize Days 10–14) — Integration tests for core flow; smoke tests must pass prior to release.

Acceptance rules

- An item is considered Done when:
  1. The implementing ISSUE is closed and PR includes the traceability line: `NEXT_STEPS: <section> — MVP_CHECKLIST: <section> — ROADMAP: Phase 0`.
  2. Relevant NEXT_STEPS checkboxes are updated.
  3. Unit tests and at least one integration/smoke test for the flow are added and pass locally or in CI.

Priority labels & branch naming

- Labels: `v0.1-priority`, `mvp`, `next_steps`, `roadmap-phase-0`.
- Branches: `v0.1/<short-task-name>` (e.g., `v0.1/preview-endpoint`).

Release readiness

- Before merging the final v0.1 branch, ensure:
  - Preview and Export flows pass smoke tests in devcontainer.
  - Override persistence works and is covered by tests.
  - Documentation updated (README + devcontainer notes) with quick start and any known degraded modes.

## PR checklist (short)

Follow this checklist before marking a PR as `ready`:

- [ ] PR body includes traceability line: `NEXT_STEPS: <section> — MVP_CHECKLIST: <section> — ROADMAP: <phase>`
- [ ] Tests added or updated for new behavior (unit/integration)
- [ ] Update `docs/TRACEABILITY.md` or relevant NEXT_STEPS if scope changed
- [ ] Labels added: `next_steps`, `mvp`, `roadmap-phase-0` (as applicable)
- [ ] Local lint and tests pass

Notes: This file is small and aims to help reviewers verify minimal project policy compliance.

# Actionables for Bug Fixes

This document outlines the issues found and the steps to resolve them.

## 1. State Management Issue ✅ Resolved (9/25/2025 @ 1:20PM)

### Issue

After a successful content generation and preview update, the UI state is erroneously updated to an error state: `{status: error, message: No valid content provided for preview}`. This happens during the `persistContent` step.

### Possible Fixes

The issue likely lies within the client-side state management, specifically in how the `contentStore` and `uiStateStore` interact. The `persistContent` function might be causing an incorrect state mutation or a race condition.

### Actionables

- [x] Review the `persistContent` function in the client-side code.
- [x] Analyze the Svelte stores responsible for UI state (`uiStateStore`) and content (`contentStore`).
- [x] Trace the state changes during the content generation and persistence flow.
- [x] Correct the logic to ensure the UI state reflects the correct status after content is persisted.

## 2. Dual API Calls ✅ Resolved (9/25/2025 @ 1:25PM)

### Issue

Two separate API calls are made for what appears to be the same purpose:

1. `POST /prompt`
2. `POST /api/prompts`

This is inefficient and can lead to synchronization issues.

### Possible Fixes

This is likely caused by two different parts of the application logic making API requests. This could be due to legacy code or two different stores performing similar actions.

### Actionables

- [x] Identify the locations in the client-side code where `POST /prompt` and `POST /api/prompts` are called.
- [x] Determine if both calls are necessary.
- [x] Consolidate the API calls into a single, efficient request.
- [x] Refactor the related code to use the single API call.
- [x] Ensure that the backend handles the consolidated request correctly.

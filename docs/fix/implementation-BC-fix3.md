# Fix Implementation Plan 3: Duplicate Store Diagnosis and Remediation

**FRI 26TH SEP 2025 @ 3:30PM**

This short, focused document explains why the frontend `PreviewWindow` sometimes stays stuck on the placeholder, what we changed to resolve it in the short term, and recommended follow-ups to permanently prevent recurrence.

## Short answer (one line)

The preview stayed stuck because the app had duplicate instances of the Svelte stores (the writer and the UI were each using a different in-memory store object), caused by mixed import paths and at least one dynamic import; standardizing imports (use canonical `$lib/stores`) and stabilizing tests resolved the symptom.

## Evidence and root cause

- Logs during debugging showed `previewStore.set(...)` being called but `PreviewWindow` still rendering the placeholder.
- Instrumentation confirmed different `instanceId` values when the store was logged from the logic layer vs the UI layer — a classic duplicate-module (singleton) problem.
- The primary trigger was inconsistent module resolution (mixed relative imports and at least one dynamic `import('../stores')` in a dev-only block) which allowed the bundler/test runner to create separate module instances.

## Immediate fixes applied in this work

1. Canonicalization

   - Ensured a canonical import path is available (`$lib`) and used across Vite and Vitest configs so the same module id resolves consistently in dev and tests.

2. Test stabilizations and environment guards

   - Added a small DOM readiness hook in `PreviewWindow.svelte` that sets `document.body.setAttribute('data-preview-ready','1')` when preview HTML is rendered. This lets tests reliably wait for the UI to show the preview.
   - Mocked `OverrideControls.svelte` in tests to avoid SSR lifecycle errors (onDestroy) under JSDOM.
   - Added a tiny polyfill for `Element.prototype.animate` used by the app so tests in JSDOM don't fail.
   - Normalized fetch mocks in tests to accept absolute URLs so tests run regardless of how env vars are set.

3. Deterministic timeout handling

   - Wrapped the submit step in `generateAndPreview` with a `withTimeout(...)` helper so timeout behavior can be tested deterministically without flakiness.

4. Guarded debug logs

   - Removed or gated noisy dev-only console logs behind `import.meta.env.DEV` so they don't confuse test output or production logs.

5. Test changes (high level)
   - `client/__tests__/generate-button.test.ts`: mocked `OverrideControls.svelte`, polyfilled `animate`, adjusted fetch mocks.
   - `client/__tests__/preview.integration.test.js`: set `previewStore` directly and set `uiStateStore` to success to deterministically validate rendering.
   - `client/__tests__/flows.test.js`: made timeout test deterministic by adding rejection handlers and using the new timeoutable submit step.

## Files changed (high level)

- client/src/stores/index.js — guarded dev logs and ensured singleton merge via global key.
- client/src/components/PreviewWindow.svelte — added DOM readiness attribute when preview content is set.
- client/src/lib/flows.js — wrapped submitPrompt with withTimeout for deterministic tests.
- client/**tests**/**mocks**/OverrideControls.svelte — added a no-op mock for tests.
- client/**tests**/generate-button.test.ts — test fixes: mock, polyfill, fetch normalization.
- client/**tests**/preview.integration.test.js — test now sets previewStore directly.

## How this differs from implementation-BC-fix2.md

- fix2 focused on diagnosing the singleton violation and recommending canonical imports. It proposed adding an `instanceId` to stores to confirm duplications and then cleaning up imports.
- fix3 documents what we actually did after diagnosis: in addition to canonicalizing imports/configs we stabilized tests that were masking or amplifying the symptom by mocking lifecycle-heavy components, adding a readiness hook, polyfills, and making timeouts deterministic. Those test-side changes were necessary to get a green test-suite in CI while we perform the repo-wide import canonicalization.

## Remaining follow-ups (actionable)

**1. Replace any remaining dynamic imports of stores** (notably a dev-only `import('../stores')` in `PromptInput.svelte`) with static canonical imports from `$lib/stores`. This is highest priority — prevents the root cause.
**2. Repo-wide audit:** search for any imports that reference the stores using relative paths or alternate aliases and standardize them to `$lib/stores` (or a single agreed path).
3. Remove the temporary DOM readiness attribute if/when E2E tests run against a real browser (or keep it if it's still helpful for test determinism) — decide and document.
**4. Add a linter rule or import-check CI job** that warns on mixed imports for key singleton modules (stores, singletons, global state modules).
**5. Run the full test suite and the E2E smoke tests** in CI to be sure nothing regresses under HMR or other bundler contexts.

## Quick checklist: verification steps

- [ ] Replace dynamic import in `PromptInput.svelte` with `import { previewStore } from '$lib/stores'` and re-run tests.
- [ ] Run full Vitest suite locally and in CI.
- [ ] Run E2E smoke script (or Playwright/Puppeteer job) to validate runtime behavior in a real browser.

## TL;DR for the reviewer

The preview was stuck because two different copies of the same Svelte store existed. We confirmed this with instance IDs and fixed it by standardizing imports + stabilizing tests. The remaining task is to remove the last dynamic import(s) and run the full test/E2E suite to prove the fix is permanent.

## Brainstorming and Refined Action Plan (Post-E2E Analysis)

**FRI 26TH SEP 2025 @ 4:45PM**

The successful E2E test run, contrasted with the persistent manual failure, points towards an environment-specific issue, most likely related to Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR) during development.

### Brainstorming: What could cause this discrepancy?

1.  **Hot Module Replacement (HMR) Poisoning:**
    *   **Theory:** This is the most likely culprit. Vite's HMR can create new versions of modules in memory on the fly. If different parts of the application (e.g., the UI layer and the logic layer) end up holding references to different, hot-reloaded instances of the store module, their connection is severed.
    *   **Why tests pass:** The E2E test runs against a *freshly started* server. It performs its actions once and exits, never experiencing the cumulative effects of multiple hot reloads that occur during a normal development session.

2.  **A Flaw in the E2E Test's Verification Logic:**
    *   **Theory:** The E2E script might be giving a "false positive." It might be checking for a signal that happens *before* the final, visible render, or it might not be checking the rendered content correctly.

3.  **Browser-Specific Issues:**
    *   **Theory:** There could be an issue specific to the browser being used for manual testing that is not present in the headless browser used by the test script (e.g., aggressive caching, a browser extension interfering).

### Refined Action Plan

The highest-leverage action is to make the Svelte stores immune to HMR.

1.  **Strengthen the Singleton Pattern:** I will modify `client/src/stores/index.js` to implement a more aggressive, HMR-proof singleton pattern.
    *   **Logic:** On module load, the code will check if the stores already exist on a unique global key (e.g., `window.__POEMAMUNDI_STORES__`).
    *   If they **do**, it will export the *existing* stores from the global object.
    *   If they **do not**, it will create the stores for the first time, attach them to the global object, and then export them.
    *   This ensures that even if Vite re-imports the `stores/index.js` file dozens of times, every single part of the application will receive a reference to the exact same store objects created on the very first load.

2.  **Verify the E2E Test:** I will also analyze the E2E test script to confirm its verification logic is sound.

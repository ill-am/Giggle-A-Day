# V0.1 Finalization Plan

_Generated: August 23, 2025 - Focus: Summer Poems eBook Demo_

This document outlines the minimal path to complete V0.1, specifically focused on delivering the demo goal:

> Produce an A4 eBook of public-domain summer poems â€” one poem per page with a poem-describing decorative background image

## Core Requirements Analysis

   - [x] Prompt endpoint (2h remaining)
     - [x] Basic endpoint implemented
     - [ ] Add summer-specific prompt enhancement
     - [ ] Add error handling for AI service failures

2. **Image Generation Integration**

   - [ ] Background Image Pipeline (4h)
     - [ ] Integrate Gemini image generation
     - [ ] Add poem-to-image prompt formatting
     - [ ] Implement image quality validation
     - [ ] Add fallback handling for failed generations

3. **PDF Generation & Quality**

   - [ ] A4 PDF Export Pipeline (3h)
     - [ ] Configure Puppeteer for A4 format
     - [ ] Add page-per-poem layout template
     - [ ] Implement image-text composition
     - [ ] Add basic quality checks (DPI, fonts)

4. **Minimal UI Requirements**

   - [x] Basic Prompt Interface (1h remaining)
     - [x] Prompt input implemented
     - [ ] Add summer poems specific guidance
   - [x] Preview Implementation (0.5h remaining)
     - [x] Basic preview working
     - [ ] Add image placement preview
   - [x] Export Controls (0.5h remaining)
     - [x] Export button implemented
     - [ ] Add export progress indicator

5. **Critical Testing**
   - [ ] E2E Demo Flow (2h)
     - [ ] Test full summer poem generation
     - [ ] Verify image generation
     - [ ] Validate PDF output quality
   - [ ] Error Handling (2h)
     - [ ] Test AI service failures
     - [ ] Test image generation failures
     - [ ] Test PDF export errors

## Priority Tasks (In Order)

1. **Image Generation Integration** (4h)

   - Highest priority as it's completely missing
   - Required for demo goal completion

2. **PDF Quality Enhancement** (3h)

   - Critical for demo output quality
   - Focus on A4 formatting and image placement

3. **E2E Testing & Error Handling** (4h)

   - Essential for demo reliability
   - Focus on happy path + critical error cases

4. **UI Refinements** (2h)
   - Polish existing implementation
   - Add minimal required features

## Total Time Estimate: 13 hours

### Success Criteria

1. Generate summer-themed poem with appropriate prompt enhancement
2. Generate matching decorative background image
3. Compose poem and image in A4 PDF format
4. Export high-quality multi-page eBook
5. Handle basic error cases gracefully

### Not Required for V0.1

1. Advanced error handling
2. Performance optimization
3. Full type coverage
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. Production deployment guide

## Next Actions (In Priority Order)

1. Start image generation integration
2. Enhance PDF generation for A4 with images
3. Implement critical path error handling
4. Add minimal UI enhancements
5. Run and verify E2E tests

_Note: This plan focuses only on components directly required for the summer poems eBook demo, deferring all non-essential features to post-V0.1._

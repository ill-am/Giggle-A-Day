# GUI Resolution — Actionable Checklist

This document converts analysis and the fix plan into a concrete, checkable list of tasks. Each item is small, timeboxed, and includes acceptance criteria. Status is maintained across GUI_UNRESPONSIVENESS.md, GUI_FIX_PLAN.md, and this checklist.

Owner: @dev-team (or whoever picks the task)

## 1. Data Layer Migration (Phase 1 continuation) — 90m

- [x] Set up Prisma schema and validate
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL connection
- [x] Implement and verify health monitoring

- [ ] Replace SQLite CRUD usage in `server/crud.js` with Prisma Client calls.
  - Acceptance: `crud.createPrompt`, `crud.getPrompt`, `crud.saveResult` use Prisma and pass unit tests.
- [ ] Update `server/worker-sqlite.mjs` to use Prisma or create `worker-postgres.mjs` wrapper.
  - Acceptance: Worker can process at least one job end-to-end using PostgreSQL.
- [ ] Add transaction boundaries for multi-step operations where previously implicit.
  - Acceptance: Unit test demonstrates rollback on simulated failure.

## 2. Store & Handler Cleanup (Phase 2) — 45m

- [x] Implement basic store structure (promptStore, contentStore, previewStore, uiStateStore)
  - Acceptance: All core stores are in place and properly initialized
- [ ] Update `client/src/stores/contentStore` to fetch/save via the API which persists to PostgreSQL
  - Acceptance: Setting `contentStore` triggers a POST to server endpoints which persist data
- [x] Remove local preview shortcut from `PromptInput.svelte`
  - Acceptance: `previewStore` is updated only by `PreviewWindow` via `loadPreview`
- [x] Remove `handleGenerateClick` and typed-prompt dialog state from `PromptInput.svelte`
  - Acceptance: Only `handleGenerateNow` is used; UI retains expected behavior

## 3. Preview Consolidation (Phase 3) — 30m

- [x] Set up basic PreviewWindow component with core functionality
  - Acceptance: Component renders and handles basic preview operations
- [x] Implement proper debouncing (200ms) in PreviewWindow
  - Acceptance: Preview updates are properly throttled
- [x] Add auto-preview toggle functionality
  - Acceptance: Users can enable/disable automatic preview updates
- [ ] Move remaining preview responsibilities to `PreviewWindow.svelte`
  - Acceptance: `PromptInput` no longer touches `previewStore` or buildLocalPreviewHtml
- [x] Implement cancellation for in-flight `loadPreview` requests
  - Acceptance: Rapid successive prompts cancel previous requests and show latest preview
- [x] Ensure debouncing remains only in `PreviewWindow`
  - Acceptance: Auto-preview works; no double-render flashes in automated tests

## 4. Status & UI Feedback (Phase 4) — 30m

- [ ] Centralize UI status changes into `uiStateStore` helpers
  - Implement `setUiLoading`, `setUiSuccess`, `setUiError`
  - Add proper timeout management
  - Implement message queuing system
  - Acceptance: All components use helpers; status messages show consistently and persist until state changes
- [ ] Improve visual feedback system
  - Prevent animation stacking
  - Add proper loading indicators
  - Implement smooth transitions
  - Acceptance: Multiple rapid clicks produce a single flash cycle and clear status transitions

## 5. Tests & Validation (Phase 5) — 45m

- [ ] Database Integration Tests
  - Test PostgreSQL connection resilience
  - Verify transaction rollback scenarios
  - Validate data consistency
  - Acceptance: All database operations are verified stable and consistent
- [ ] UI Integration Tests
  - Test preview update sequence
  - Verify status message visibility
  - Test animation behavior
  - Acceptance: Tests cover happy-path and 2 failure modes (network error, db error)
- [ ] Edge Case Validation
  - Test rapid successive clicks
  - Verify network delay handling
  - Validate error conditions
  - Acceptance: No uncaught exceptions; UI shows correct status

## 6. Docs & Hand-off — 15m

- [ ] Update documentation to reflect current status
  - Cross-reference GUI_FIX_PLAN.md and GUI_UNRESPONSIVENESS.md
  - Update completion status and remaining items
  - Document any new patterns or requirements discovered
  - Acceptance: Documentation accurately reflects current state and remaining work

Total focused dev time (adjusted estimate): 4 hours 15 minutes

Notes:

- Infrastructure components (Prisma, PostgreSQL, basic stores) are already in place
- Focus is on integration and remaining UI improvements
- Testing should concentrate on new changes and integration points
- Documentation updates should maintain cross-document traceability

Notes:

- If the project already requires multiple commits for the Prisma migration (it does), split PRs per area: DB migration, stores/handlers, preview refactor, UI feedback.
- Prioritize Phase 2 and 3 first to make the GUI responsive; database migration is critical but can be staged alongside these UI changes.

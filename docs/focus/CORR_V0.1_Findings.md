# V0.1 Correction Findings and Plan

Recorded: 2025-09-08

## Current State (feat/V0.1-implementation)

**Status**: Non-responsive GUI with following buttons present:

- 'Summer suggestion'
- 'Load V0.1 demo'
- 'Generate'
- 'Preview'
- 'Run smoke test'

**Critical Note**: The master prototype branch (feat/V0.1-implementation) is preserved as-is. No modifications will be made until a complete fix is validated.

## Documentation Phase

1. Current Investigation

   - Document exact state of GUI components
   - Identify all failure points
   - Map data flow through components

2. Analysis & Planning

   - Catalog all required fixes
   - Define correction approach
   - Establish validation criteria

3. Implementation Strategy
   - To be detailed after consensus on approach
   - Will use separate correction branches
   - Must preserve V0.1 artifacts for reference

## Next Steps

1. Complete documentation of current state
2. Reach consensus on correction approach
3. Create detailed implementation plan
4. Begin corrections in isolated branches

## Reference Information

- Original implementation is preserved in feat/V0.1-implementation
- Corrections will be tracked in corr/V0.1-findings branch
- All changes must be validated before consideration for integration

## Validation Requirements

To be established during consensus phase. Will include:

- GUI responsiveness criteria
- Data flow verification
- Integration test requirements

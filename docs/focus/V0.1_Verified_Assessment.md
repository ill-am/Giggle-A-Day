## Next Actions

1. **Immediate Verification Needs:**

   - Review client/src/components/ for actual UI implementation status
   - Check server/pdfGenerator.js for PDF quality measures
   - Assess actual test coverage across packages
   - Review existing documentation completeness

2. **Documentation Gaps to Address:**

   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Document implemented UI features
   - Document PDF quality assurance measures

3. **Implementation Verification:**
   - Test loading states in UI
   - Verify error handling implementation
   - Check PDF quality assurance tools
   - Validate E2E test reliability

## Notes on Verification Process

To verify each item's status, we should:

1. Review relevant code files
2. Run tests where available
3. Document findings in this assessment
4. Update checkboxes based on verified status

This document should be updated as verification proceeds to maintain an accurate picture of V0.1 completion status.

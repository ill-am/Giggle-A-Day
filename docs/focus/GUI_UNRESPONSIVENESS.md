# GUI Unresponsiveness Analysis

> Actionable remediations and step-by-step tasks are in `GUI_RESOLUTION.md`.

## 1. Preview Update Race Conditions

- **Flow**: User submits prompt → createPrompt called → preview update triggered
- **Issue**: Multiple preview updates can be triggered simultaneously
- **Example**:
  ```
  1. User clicks "Generate"
  2. [crud.createPrompt] called
  3. Preview doesn't update immediately
  4. User clicks "Generate" again
  5. Both updates try to run concurrently
  ```
- **Impact**: Preview flashes, shows incorrect content, or fails to update

## 2. Status Message Visibility

- **Flow**: Operation starts → status set → UI should update
- **Issue**: Status messages not consistently displayed or updated
- **Examples**:
  - Loading indicators don't appear during operations
  - Success/error messages briefly flash then disappear
  - Status changes don't reflect actual operation state
- **Faulty Logic**: Status updates in PromptInput.svelte bypass the central state management

## 3. Component State Management

- **Flow**: Multiple stores (promptStore, contentStore, previewStore) updating asynchronously
- **Issue**: Lack of clear ownership and state flow between components
- **Examples**:
  - PromptInput.svelte directly updates preview state
  - PreviewWindow.svelte has its own preview logic
  - Both components try to manage the same state
- **Impact**: State desyncs, redundant updates, UI inconsistencies

## 4. Event Handler Redundancy

- **Flow**: Multiple handlers for similar actions in PromptInput.svelte
- **Issue**: Overlapping functionality and inconsistent behavior
- **Examples**:
  - handleGenerateClick vs handleGenerateNow
  - Local preview creation bypassing server
  - Redundant typedPromptDialog code
- **Impact**: Code complexity and potential race conditions

## 5. Animation and Timing Issues

- **Flow**: Loading states → animations → content updates
- **Issue**: Poor coordination between visual feedback and actual operations
- **Examples**:
  - Flash animations stack when clicking multiple times
  - Loading states don't properly reflect operation progress
  - Debouncing conflicts with direct updates
- **Impact**: Confusing user feedback, apparent unresponsiveness
